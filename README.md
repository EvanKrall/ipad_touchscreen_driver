# ipad_touchscreen_driver

This is part of my larger [project to put a single-board computer inside the original iPad](https://hackaday.io/project/177256-put-a-modern-sbc-into-an-original-ipad).

This circuit uses the mXT2952TD touchscreen controller from Microchip, which seems to be the only capacitive touchscreen controller available in small quantities that has enough TX and RX lines to drive the iPad's screen.

See the rendered images and gerbers on the [releases page](https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver/releases/latest/)
