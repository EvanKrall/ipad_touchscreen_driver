# ipad_touchscreen_driver (deprecated)

**This repo is deprecated because the mXT2952 is too tiny for cheap PCB houses to handle. See the new design in my [ipad_touchscreen_driver_gt9113](https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver_gt9113) repo.**

This is part of my larger [project to put a single-board computer inside the original iPad](https://hackaday.io/project/177256-put-a-modern-sbc-into-an-original-ipad).

This circuit uses the mXT2952TD touchscreen controller from Microchip, which seems to be the only capacitive touchscreen controller available in small quantities that has enough TX and RX lines to drive the iPad's screen.

See the rendered images and gerbers on the [releases page](https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver/releases/latest/)

## Please give feedback!

I'm still quite new at PCB design, and this board has many firsts for me (first BGA, first 4-layer board, first board of such small pitch).
I haven't yet had this board manufactured, so it is untested.
If you notice anything that seems wrong, it's probably wrong.
I would very much appreciate any advice you can give.
Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver/issues/new) or add a comment on the [Hackaday project page](https://hackaday.io/project/177256-put-a-modern-sbc-into-an-original-ipad).
